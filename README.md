# Random Forest Classifier Tutorial 🌲

This project is a companion tutorial for learning how to use the **Random Forest Classifier** for binary classification tasks. It demonstrates the method on the Wine Dataset from Kaggle, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature importance.

## 📚 Tutorial

The full tutorial (PDF) is included in this repository:  
📄 [random_forest_classifier_tutorial.pdf](./random_forest_classifier_tutorial.pdf)

It walks through the theoretical background, implementation, and interpretability of the model.
